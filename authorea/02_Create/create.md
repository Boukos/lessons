### Creating new Authorea documents.

Once an account has been created, you are taken to the homepage that lists
all documents you have created in Authorea.

Currently there are none, so to create a new document simply click on the New
Article Icon. 

This will take you to a new window where you enter in the details of your 
new document. 

+ Give your document a name in the Project Title field.
+ Set the format of your article, it can be in Markdown or in LaTeX (We will be using LaTeX).
+ You can use a set template to create an article, select from dropdown menu.
+ Toggle article commenting. 
+ Toggle article availability.
+ Click submit.

Congratulations you have created your first Authorea document and you will
be presented with the edit window.
