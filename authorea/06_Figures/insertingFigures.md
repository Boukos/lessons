### Inserting figures.

To insert a figure, simply hover your mouse over a text block and select the insert figure button.
Alternatively, you can or simply click and drag your figure into the document (Authorea accepts most 
file formats for pictures). 

Within the caption field, Authorea accepts the ```/label``` encoding which gives the figure a label
for cross referencing (```\ref{}```) in the manuscript.

##### Challenge 

Insert a figure and give it a label in the caption. Once saved, note what 
Authorea does with formatting the figure and caption after you save and close. Try resizing your
figure with the inbuilt button.
