###Inserting figures in Authorea

It is straightforward to insert a figure into an Authorea document, there is also functionality
to cross reference the figure within the document as if it was a latex document.

Simply click on select figure at the bottom of the section you would like to insert your figure.

Or simply click and drag your figure into the document.

Authorea accepts most file formats for pictures. 

Within the caption field, Authorea accepts the /label encoding which gives the figure a label
for cross referencing in the manuscript.

** Challenge ** : Insert a figure and give it a label in the caption. Once saved, note what 
Authorea does with formatting the figure and caption after you save and close. Try resizing your
figure with the inbuilt button.
