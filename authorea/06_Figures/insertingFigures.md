###Inserting figures in Authorea

It is straightforward to insert a figure into an Authorea document, there is also functionality
to cross reference the figure within the document as if it was a latex document.

Simply click on select figure at the bottom of the section you would like to insert your figure.

Or simply click and drag your figure into the document.

Within the caption field, Authorea accepts the /label encoding which gives the figure a label
for cross referencing.
