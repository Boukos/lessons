### Inserting citations.

Authorea can insert citations (and an associated bibliography) via the insert citation button in the document editor (+).
Once you click the insert citation button, you have the option of inserting the DOI of the paper you want to cite,

![citations](../images/citation02.png)

or by searching for your paper through PubMed or other citation search engines.

![citations](../images/citation01.png)

Authorea will then insert your citation and format your bioliography according to the output
format you specifiy. The citation is created as a BibTex bibilography file and this can be found in the folders tab.
Since the referencing is based on the BibTex format, you can also directly paste in BibTex citations as well. 

To use a reference more than once, simply copy and paste the encoded citation to other sentences in the document.

##### Challenge 

Add a couple of citations to your manuscript. How does the behaviour of the citation change if you use ```\citep``` or ```\citet```?
