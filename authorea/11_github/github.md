### Integration with GitHub

Authorea backs up your manuscript on their servers, however for added peace of mind you may wish to keep a backup of your own.
To facilitate this process, Authorea makes it really easy to integrate with your own personal GitHub account.  

To set this up, click on the settings button (at top right of any article) you'll see a "github integration" section. Click the big green
"setup a deploy key" button and Authorea will walk you through the process.  

Once you're setup, you can push and pull from your GitHub repo by replacing `/_show_article` in the URL for your manuscript with `git_functions`.
This will take you to a page where you can push and pull. Simple as that!

##### Challenge

Go ahead and link your manuscript with GitHub (you'll need to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one). Notice 
how the commit history in GitHub matches with the content in the history tab on your article page.
