### Making comments on your document.

In the bottom left hand corner of any text box you'll see a little space labelled ```Optional: Type here a short summary of your changes```. It's a good idea to update this space before you hit the "save and close" button, as those comments get added to the history tab for your collaborators (and your future self) to see (like Git).

If you hover your mouse over a text box or figure you'll also be presented (in the bottom right-hand corner) with the option of commenting on that section. This is a great way to communicate with collaborators, and it's also a great feature if you make your article public. You can send a link to your document to any colleagues who you think might be interested in the work, and they can give you direct feedback (yay for open science!).

Unfortunately you have to regularly check the document for updates to comments - at this stage Authorea does not notify 
authors of new comments or edits.

The final thing we need to do is [export the document](../10_exportingDocument/expotingFinalDocument.md).
