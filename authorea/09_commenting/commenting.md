###Making comments on your document

With every change you make in a section, you can add comments as to what you have done to that section
for other collaborators to see (Like Git).

You can also comment (like chat) to communicate with your collaborators on the manuscript.

Unfortunately you have to regularly check the document for updates, at this stage Authorea does not notify 
authors of new comments or edits.
