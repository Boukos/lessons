### Adding collaborators to your draft document.

To begin sharing your manuscript (and allowing access if the manuscript is
set to private) you can add a collaborator.

The collaborator does not need to already have an Authorea account, they 
would be sent an invitation to join. However, in order to collaborate, you
must have a Authorea account.

If your collaborator has an exisiting Authorea account they have be linked
by using the email address they used to set up their account. Authorea then
finds their account and then adds the draft document to their own list of 
documents in Authorea.
