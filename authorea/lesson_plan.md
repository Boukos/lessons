## Authorea lesson plan

Objectives of the workshop
> To raise awareness of authorea as a collaborative maunscript authoring tool 


> To give the basic tools and pointers to getting started with authorea

### 1. Authorea in context

Discuss Authorea in the context of other online editors and it's place in the open science movement as an
alternative pre-print server. This is all covered in [this post](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/88732843274/authorea-a-review).

Points to convey:
* Most authors are used to Microsoft Word. Not ideal for collaborative documents.
* Track Changes, bibliography and cross referencing is a pain.
* Math formula in Word is clumsy.
* LaTex and Authorea could be a solution. Git in the background.
* Point to decision [flow diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JQA6NyItxiKtkmGBWiGL9Bqk0asU064Cr3FF1ZT_nq8/edit#slide=id.p).

**Challenge:** Create an Authorea account and document.

* Create a document. 
* Start sharing your doucment by adding authors to document (your neighbour in the workshop).

2. [Creating a document](02_Create/create.md)

3. [Add co-authors](03_AddCollaborators/addCollaborators.md)


### 2. Basic functionality

Overview the structure of the document interface:

* Main window
  * Text editor
  * Insert references
  * Insert images
  * Insert tables
* Folders
  * Directory structure
* History
  * Edit histories
  * Author edit tracking
* Chat
  * Commenting

Walthrough can be found [here](04_DraftingLatex/draftingLatex.md)

## Editing a document
* Adding sections/chapters to document
* Editing text
* [Citations and bibliography](07_Citations/insertingCitations.md)
* [Crossreferencing](06_Figures/insertingFigures.md)

## Exporting a document
* Predefined journal formats
* PDF
* LaTeX (i.e. if you don't like the default PDF styles, you can download the raw LaTeX file and compile it yourself)

Walkthrough can be found [here](10_exportingDocument/exportingFinalDocument.md)

### 3. Web-friendly LaTeX

LaTeX is great for writing research articles (particularly those with mathematical equations) but it was made
with the printed page in mind (see [here](https://authorea.com/users/3/articles/4675/_show_article) for a detailed 
discussion). The team at Authorea have therefore put together a web-friendly LaTeX 
[cheat sheet](https://authorea.com/users/3/articles/6868/_show_article). 

**Challenge:** Use the cheat sheet to produce a document that briefly summarises you current research. Export that document in your favorite PDF style.

### 4. Version control

In the FAQ section of the Authorea [help page](https://www.authorea.com/help) it tells you how to link 
your document to your own GitHub account.

**Challenge:** Create a GitHub account and link your document to it. Make some changes to your document
and then push those changes to GitHub.

### 5. Include your code

Demonstrate how you can include your code (such as an IPython notebook) in your document (see 
[here](https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3904/_show_article) for details)
