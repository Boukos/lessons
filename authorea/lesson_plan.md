## Authorea lesson plan

### 1. Authorea in context

Discuss Authorea in the context of other online editors and it's place in the open science movement as an
alternative pre-print server. This is all covered in [this post](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/88732843274/authorea-a-review).

**Challenge:** Create an Authorea account.

### 2. Basic functionality

Show the audience the four main tabs:

* Main (how to edit text, comment on sections, insert references, etc)
* Folder
* History
* Chat

Discuss the options for exporting documents:

* PDF
* LaTeX (i.e. if you don't like the default PDF styles, you can download the raw LaTeX file and compile it yourself)

### 3. Web-friendly LaTeX

LaTeX is great for writing research articles (particularly those with mathematical equations) but it was made
with the printed page in mind (see [here](https://authorea.com/users/3/articles/4675/_show_article) for a detailed 
discussion). The team at Authorea have therefore put together a web-friendly LaTeX 
[cheat sheet](https://authorea.com/users/3/articles/6868/_show_article). 

**Challenge:** Use the cheat sheet to produce a document that briefly summarises you current research. Export that document in your favorite PDF style.

### 4. Version control

In the FAQ section of the Authorea [help page](https://www.authorea.com/help) it tells you how to link 
your document to your own GitHub account.

**Challenge:** Create a GitHub account and link your document to it. Make some changes to your document
and then push those changes to GitHub.

### 5. Include your code

Demonstrate how you can include your code (such as an IPython notebook) in your document (see 
[here](https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3904/_show_article) for details)
