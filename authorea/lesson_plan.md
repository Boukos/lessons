## Authorea lesson plan

Objectives of the workshop
> To raise awareness of authorea as a collaborative maunscript authoring tool 

> To give the basic tools and pointers to getting started with authorea

### Authorea in context

Discuss Authorea in the context of other online editors and it's place in the open science movement as an
alternative pre-print server. This is all covered in [this post](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/88732843274/authorea-a-review).

Points to convey:
* Most authors are used to Microsoft Word. Not ideal for collaborative documents.
* Track changes, bibliography and cross referencing is a pain.
* Math formula in Word is clumsy.
* LaTex and Authorea could be a solution. Git in the background.
* Point to decision [flow diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JQA6NyItxiKtkmGBWiGL9Bqk0asU064Cr3FF1ZT_nq8/edit#slide=id.p).

### Version control (Advanced)

In the FAQ section of the Authorea [help page](https://www.authorea.com/help) it tells you how to link 
your document to your own GitHub account.

**Challenge:** Create a GitHub account and link your document to it. Make some changes to your document
and then push those changes to GitHub.

### Include your code (Advanced)

Demonstrate how you can include your code (such as an IPython notebook) in your document (see 
[here](https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3904/_show_article) for details)
