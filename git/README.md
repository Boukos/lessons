Git teaching content
====================

The first two lessons (`00-intro.md` and `01-backup.md`) are the same for
both novice and intermediate audiences, but after that the content diverges. 
* The novice lessons cover the bare minimum that a lone researcher (i.e. not collaborating 
with others) needs to know in order to get started with version control. 
* The intermediate lessons target researchers working/collaborating in a small team and thus 
includes extra material about branching and pull requests. It also contains a final lesson 
on open access / copyright issues, which isn't included in the novice material.   

The markdown (.md) notes in this directory are mostly complete, but in places there are missing figures. Students may
therefore also wish to refer to [this](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/index.html) version of the notes, which is maintained by Software Carpentry.
