Conclusion
==========

The importance of what is taught at a bootcamp is captured in this
[blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/why-attend-bootcamp.html).  

The best way get help after a bootcamp is by interacting with other researchers who write code. If
you're in Melbourne, then the easiest way to do this is by coming along to [Hacky Hour](https://github.com/resbaz/hackerwin). Most programming languages/packages also have their own 
mailing lists, user groups, support forums and/or conferences (e.g. [PyConAu](http://2014.pycon-au.org/)). 
Software Carpentry is also thinking of [starting a forum](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/creating-a-forum.html) that is like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) but aimed at a more appropriate level of expertise (i.e. for 
programming novices as opposed to experts).
