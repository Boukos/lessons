Conclusion
==========

Most people feel a little overwhelmed at the end of a bootcamp. The two most important things to note are:   

* You don't have to incorporate everything you've learned into your daily workflow right away. In fact, it's not uncommon for people have items like "start using version control" or "add assertions to my code" on their to-do list for a number of months after a bootcamp 
* Don't stress if you didn't master all the content. The most important thing is that you are no longer ignorant to the well-established best practices in computational research. In other words, you now know what you don't know, which is a very important first step (this
[blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/why-attend-bootcamp.html) gives a nice summary of why this is so important)  

### Getting help

The best way get help after a bootcamp is by interacting with other researchers who write code. If
you're in Melbourne, then the easiest way to do this is by coming along to [Hacky Hour](https://github.com/resbaz/hackerwin). Most programming languages/packages also have their own 
mailing lists, user groups, support forums and/or conferences (e.g. [PyConAu](http://2014.pycon-au.org/)). 
Software Carpentry is also thinking of [starting a forum](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/creating-a-forum.html) that is like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) but aimed at a more appropriate level of expertise (i.e. for programming novices as opposed to experts).
