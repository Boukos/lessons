We make use of the Software Carpentry novice and intermediate level python teaching materials. 

### Novice lessons

The six core novice python lessons are available 
[here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/python) at the Software 
Carpentry github bc repo. They can also be viewed at the 
[lessons page](http://www.software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) of their website. Their
content is as follows:

#### 1. Introduction to Data Analysis

An introductory example of how to perform typical data analysis tasks in Python.

*Topics:* importing libraries/modules, calling functions/attributes (modules) or 
methods/members (classes), reading and storing data, variable assignment, indexing 
(including slice and stride), basic plotting, array operations
  
  
#### 2. Creating Functions

Use functions to make code easier to re-use and easier to understand. 

*Topics:* defining functions, the call stack, doc strings, positional and keyword arguments 
  

#### 3. Analysing Multiple Datasets

Use lists and arrays to store related values, and loops to repeat operations on them. 

*Topics:* loops, lists
  

#### 4. Making Choices 

Have programs make choices based on the values they are manipulating. 

*Topics:* RGB color schemes, tuples, conditional statements
  

#### 5. Defensive programming

Know the how, why and when of testing your code (summarised 
[here](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/testing-your-code/)) and programming 
defensively. 

*Topics:* assertions, unit testing, test driven development
  

#### 6. Command Line Programs

Write code that allows the user to specify options at the command line, so you don't have 
to manually edit your code every time you want to make a minor change. 

*Topics:* parsing the command line
  

 
Some extra novice lessons on exceptions and numbers can also be found 
[here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/extras) at the bc repo and 
also at the lessons page. 


### Intermediate lessons

Some intermediate level python lessons are available [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/blob/master/intermediate/python). They are currently incomplete.


### Other useful resources
* See [here](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/picking-the-right-programming-language/) for a discussion
of how Python compares to the many other programming languages out there.
