Python teaching content
=======================

It should be noted that the real goal of these lessons isn't to teach Python, but to teach the basic 
concepts that all programming depends on. We simply use Python in our lessons because:

1.  we have to use *something* for examples;
2.  it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
3.  it has a large (and growing) user base among researchers; and
4.  experience shows that it's easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.

See [here](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/picking-the-right-programming-language/) for a discussion
of how Python compares to the many other programming languages out there.
