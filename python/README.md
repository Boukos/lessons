We make use of the Software Carpentry novice and intermediate level python teaching materials. 

### Novice lessons

The core novice python lessons are available [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/python) at the Software Carpentry github bc repo. They can also be viewed at the [lessons page](http://www.software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) of their website. Some extra novice lessons on exceptions and numbers can also be found [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/extras) at the bc repo and also at the lessons page. 


### Intermediate lessons

Some intermediate level python lessons are available [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/blob/master/intermediate/python). They are currently incomplete.
