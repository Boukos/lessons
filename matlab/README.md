# MATLAB teaching content

The first ever Matlab bootcamp was held in Manchester in January 2014 (see [here](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324) and [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/01/feedback-manchester-matlab-bootcamp.html) for blog posts about the event; the official event page is [here](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-01-14-manchester/)). The instructors from that event have written up the teaching materials so that they can be included in the Software Carpentry GitHub repository. An advance copy of those open source materials are what is included in this directory.

The materials include reference files and scripts for the instructor, including step-by-step lesson plans and guides for each chapter of the course. There are also exercises with full worked solutions available. The schedule and outline can be found in the [InstructorMaterials](https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/tree/master/matlab/InstructorMaterials) directory.

MathWorks have indicated that they are happy to support delivery of this course or its derivatives.  

## Prerequisite knowledge

It's not recommended to enter the bootcamp with no previous MATLAB knowledge. As pre-work for the bootcamp, we strongly recommend the [interactive online tutorial](https://www.mathworks.co.uk/academia/student_center/tutorials/) this is available free of charge for academic users. This contains more than three hours of introductory MATLAB materials and provides suitable prerequisite training prior to attendance at a MATLAB-based bootcamp.


## Installation instructions

Staff and students at the University of Melbourne are able to install Matlab on their own personal computer by following these steps.

### 1. Create a MathWorks account
