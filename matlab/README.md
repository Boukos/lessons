The first ever Matlab bootcamp was held in Manchester in January 2014 (see [here](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324) and [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/01/feedback-manchester-matlab-bootcamp.html) for blog posts about the event; the official event page is [here](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-01-14-manchester/)). The instructors from that event are in the process of writing up the teaching materials so that they can be included in the Software Carpentry GitHub repository. They estimate that this will be done by early April 2014.
