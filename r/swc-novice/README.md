See the relevant [discussion](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/r-discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/) and [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/396) for work in progress, while this [blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/04/novice-r-discussion-summary.html) gives an overview of their work plan. 

In the meantine, Sarah Supp taught an initial conversion for the recent [NYU bootcamp](http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-03-17-nyu-R/) and some nice [teaching notes](http://nicercode.github.io/2014-02-18-UTS/lessons/) have also been archived from a [bootcamp held at the University of Technology, Sydney](http://nicercode.github.io/2014-02-18-UTS/) in February 2014. The GitHub repository for these notes can be found [here](https://github.com/nicercode/2014-02-18-UTS).
