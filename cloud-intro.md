This file will explain what cloud computing is, why scientists might be interested in using the cloud, and how 
to go about getting started (e.g. how to get an account etc).

The question of why scientists might be interested in using the cloud is an interesting one. Clearly it's a useful teaching tool, because you can give lots of users the same environment and thus avoid installation issues/delays, however we aren't sure at this stage whether it would be adventageous for most Software Carpentry participants to use our IPython in the cloud environment for their daily work. This will be a subject of discussion at the usability testing session.
