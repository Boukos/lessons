## Remote computing

At some point we've all done data analysis on our own laptop or desktop computer, using whatever software package is required (e.g. Python, Matlab, R, Excel). These days, however, more and more researchers are doing their data analysis on remote computers. In other words, they simply use their own computer to access (via a network, such as the internet) a computer that is located somewhere else. This remote computing is typically given one of two labels: *supercomputing* or *cloud computing*.

### Supercomputing

In the case of supercomputing, the remote machine in question is a very large, very powerful computer such as [Raijin](http://nci.org.au/nci-systems/national-facility/peak-system/raijin/) at the National Computational Instrstructure in Canberra. Hundreds of researchers around Australia conduct their research and data analysis on Raijin every day. 

### Cloud computing

In the case of cloud computing, the remote machines are no where near as powerful. In fact, they are typically no better or more advanced than your personal laptop. This sounds like a disadvantage, until you consider that because they are so lightweight 



## How do I get access to the NeCTAR Research Cloud for this bootcamp?



Teaching notes:

* The IPython in the cloud environment comes with Vim and Nano for text editing at the command line, but no text editor like Notepad++, Kate or TextWrangler. Insttead, we will need participants to download and install the [Zed editor](http://zedapp.org/), which allows you to edit remote files.
* On a Mac, `command``+` doesn't work for zooming in with the shell environment. Instead, hold down `control` and scroll with the mouse
