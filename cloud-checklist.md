### Checklist for instructors running workshops on the cloud

1. **[During the weeks prior]**  Inform Tim Dettrick that you have a workshop coming up so that he can discuss compute node provisioning and access (and any other troubleshooting)
2. **[During the week prior]** Check the compute nodes that will be used during the workshop to make sure your lesson materials run as expected (note that existing compute nodes are not updated when Tim makes updates to the system)
3. **[During the week prior]** Contact the workshop participants and get them to create a DIT4C account before they arrive (template instructions can be found on previous workshop websites like [this one](http://resbaz.github.io/2015-02-16-resbaz-python/#setup). In this email you'll need to tell them their compute node name and access code.
4. **[On the day]** If you'd like to educate your audience on what the cloud is, [this page](https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/blob/master/cloud-intro.md) has all you need
