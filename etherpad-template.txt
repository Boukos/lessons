Welcome to the Software Carpentry Bootcamp

## FAQ's

How can I connect to the wifi?
- UniMelb people: UniWireless
- Other institutions: eduroam
- Last resort:
  - Network name: belkin.281 [5GHz]
  - Password: 4a24668e

What are the important URLs?
- Etherpad: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2014-09-15-unimelb
- Website: http://resbaz.github.io/2014-09-15-unimelb/
- Lesson notes and challenges: http://www.software-carpenry.org/lessons.html

How do I get on the cloud?
- https://dit4c.metadata.net/
- Click "not logged in" and proceed to login using your institution username and password or your 
  github credentials
- Go to the "compute nodes" tab and click "claim compute node access"
- Select a node from the drop down menu and enter the relevant access code (any node is fine)
  - GIVE DETAILS OF ACCESS CODES
- Go to the "containers" tab and create a new container named after yourself (e.g. damienirving). 
  The reason for this is that container names are unique (i.e. you can't have the same container 
  name as anyone else in the room)
- Make sure you change the type from "base" to "ipython"
- When the container is 'on', it should turn blue and you can click on it to launch
- Open a shell terminal and enter "git clone https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc.git" 
  (without the quotation marks) to get a copy of the lesson materials.


## SOFTWARE INSTALLATION SOLUTIONS

I can't import ipythonblocks...
- Open a bash shell terminal and type "sudo easy_install ipythonblocks"  (without the quotation marks) 
- If that doesn't work, cut and paste the text from the following page into a new file called ipythonblocks.py
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks/master/ipythonblocks/ipythonblocks.py
  Put the file in the same directory as you launched ipython from
- When you relaunch the IPython notepad, it should be available.

I'm having trouble installing the software...
- You might find the solution here: https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions

It is impossible for me to install the software on my machine...
- You can either create an account at SageMathCloud (https://cloud.sagemath.com/) or Wakari (https://wakari.io/) and work from there, or simply pair up with somebody who has a laptop.

I didn't install Anaconda as the default Python...
- Run "/usr/bin/anaconda/bin/python"

How do I change directory in the IPython notebook?
- The following command doesn't work: !cd
- Instead, try:
    import os
    os.chdir("/path/to/change/to")

Using git on a Mac and having problems?
- Try going to the app store and install xcode
- NEED TO FIND A BETTER SOLUTION FOR THIS

How do I call Notepad++ from the command line?

- First you need to create a path to the file you want to be able to execute.  To do this, you first need to 
  update the file-path in Gitbash.
- Open the .bashrc file in your Bash home folder (~)
- Enter or update the path to the folder that the .exe resides in:
     export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++:/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/JetBrains/PyCharm\ Community\ Edition\ 3.4.1/bin/:
- Place a semi-colon at the end of the path to then add more paths.
- You can even add the following code to your .bashrc to create a shortcut, so typing npp in Bash will now open 
  the notepad++.exe in the folder /Notepad++:
     alias npp=notepad++
