SOFTWARE INSTALLATION SOLUTIONS

I can't import ipythonblocks...
- Open a bash shell terminal and type "easy_install ipythonblocks"  (without the quotation marks) 
- If that doesn't work, try one or more of the following:

  - If you don't have easy_install, the directions at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools will tell you to: 
    - "For Windows 7 and earlier, download ez_setup.py using your favorite web browser or other technique and "run" that file."
      (i.e. right click on this link and go "Save As" https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py  Then "python ez_setup.py")

  - If you get an error message about a missing module called ez_setup: 
    - Try "easy_install ez_setup" first 
   
  - Note that from within an iPythonNotebook, you can call these commands with the ! prefix
    !easy_install ez_setup
    !easy_install ipythonblocks

- When you relaunch the IPython notepad, it should be available.

I'm having trouble installing the software...
- You might find the solution here: https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions

It is impossible for me to install the software on my machine...
- You can either create an account at SageMathCloud (https://cloud.sagemath.com/) and work from there, or simply pair up with somebody who has a laptop.

I didn't install Anaconda as the default Python...
- Run "/usr/bin/anaconda/bin/python"

How do I change directory in the IPython notebook?
- The following command doesn't work: !cd
- Instead, try:
    import os
    os.chdir("/path/to/change/to")

Using git on a Mac and having problems?
- Try going to the app store and install xcode.
