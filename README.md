Lessons
=======

This repository contains the teaching materials used by the Research Bazaar.  

The directory prefix "swc" indicates that the materials are taken largely from 
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), which is a volunteer organisation that
teaches programming skills to researchers.  

### Contributing new material

If you'd like to contribute new matieral to the lessons repo, follow these steps:  

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the lessons repository.
2. Create a new [branch](https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/blob/master/git/swc-intermediate/02-branching.md) and make all your changes/edits on that branch (i.e. do not make your changes on the `master` branch, as this makes it difficult to merge later on). If your edits are for a particular discipline and bootcamp, make that explicit in the branch name (e.g. `2014-02-30-meteorology-bootcamp`).
3. Once you're done, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and we'll review your changes.

### Bootcamp resources

Software Carpentry has a very detailed [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/operations.html) for running bootcamps, in addition to an [instructional video](http://vimeo.com/87241285) on how to create a bootcamp website.
